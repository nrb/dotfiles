# Most of the time i use ipython, which i think ignores this file.
# but if i'm not using ipython, let's set some stuff up...

# first try and set up rlcompleter2
try:
    import rlcompleter2
    print
    rlcompleter2.setup()
    del rlcompleter2
except ImportError:
    # then try and setup plain ol' readline

        del readline
    # then, well fuck, you're screwed

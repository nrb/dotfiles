README (aka WTF is this?!?!)
============================

This is a default set of confs that can be modified by you.  Have fun!

Contents
--------

Here is a list of all the files and a brief explanation of what they do.


`.ackrc`
>    Setup some new types for ack.  Add to existing types (mainly Plone)

`.bash_profile`
>    Bash shell login code

`.bashrc`
>    Bash interactive shell setup

`.commonenv`
>    Common environment settings between Bash and ZSH

`.commonfuncs`
>    Common functions used between Bash and ZSH

`.commonprofile`
>    Common login code for Bash and ZSH.  This includes code to `svn up` on
>    each login so that the profile settings stay up-to-date

`.commonrc`
>    Common interactive shell setup for Bash and ZSH. This contains all my 
>    aliases
   
`.inputrc`
>    Readline configuration.  Sets up all my command lines with vi :)

`.pystartup`
>    Interactive Python interpreter startup code.  I use it to initialize 
>    rlcompleter2 or readline with tab completion.

`.screenrc`
>    Settings for screen

`.vimrc`
>    VIM settings

`.zprofile`
>    ZSH shell login code

`.zshenv`
>    ZSH environment setup.  This includes an awesome PATH setup routine :)

`.zshprompt`
>    My default ZSH prompt.  It's a modified version of [Phil's Prompt](http://aperiodic.net/phil/prompt)

`.zshprompt_simple`
>    A simple version of my prompt that will work when the enhanced
>    characters are not available

`.zshrc`
>    ZSH interactive shell code

`config`
>    My default .subversion/config setup.  I wish I could set these defaults
>    on the server :(

`create_links.sh`
>    A shell script that aids in setting up these conf files on every server.
>    It contains an array of all the conf files that need to be symlinked.  It
>    will give you some feed back as to what it's linked and what was 'in the way'.

Usage in the wild
-----------------

Here is how I typically set up my shell on a new system.  This is assuming
subversion is available.  You could do something similar with git, but I 
haven't messed with that yet.

    $ svn co https://repo/path/to/dotfiles/trunk .dotfiles
    $ .dotfiles/create_links.sh
    linking .screenrc
    linking .vimrc
    linking .zshenv
    linking .zshprompt
    linking .zshprompt_simple
    linking .zshrc
    linking .inputrc
    linking .bash_profile
    linking .bashrc
    linking .commonrc
    linking .commonenv
    linking .commonprofile
    Remove /home/clayton/.subversion/config so that it can be linked
    linking .pystartup

Notice that it says the .subversion/config is in the way.  So let's fix that.

    $ rm .subversion/config
    $ .dotfiles/create_links.sh
    linking config

Now we are all set.  Next time we log in the confs will be updated so that any
new changes are added.

    $ ssh some-machine
    
    dotfiles updated:
    U .dotfiles/.bashrc
    At revision 10712.
    
    $ qs

Since `qs` is an alias for `.dotfiles/create_links.sh` the latest confs are in
place.

If you ever want to remove all the symlinks you can use the `create_links.sh`
script by passing it the `unlink` argument

    $ .dotfiles/create_links.sh unlink
    Unlinked /home/clayton/.screenrc
    Unlinked /home/clayton/.vimrc
    Unlinked /home/clayton/.zshenv
    Unlinked /home/clayton/.zshprompt
    Unlinked /home/clayton/.zshprompt_simple
    Unlinked /home/clayton/.zshrc
    Unlinked /home/clayton/.inputrc
    Unlinked /home/clayton/.bash_profile
    Unlinked /home/clayton/.bashrc
    Unlinked /home/clayton/.commonrc
    Unlinked /home/clayton/.commonenv
    Unlinked /home/clayton/.commonprofile
    Unlinked /home/clayton/.commonfuncs
    Unlinked /home/clayton/.subversion/config
    Unlinked /home/clayton/.pystartup
